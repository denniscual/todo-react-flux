# Flux Architecture
> Flux is the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications. It complements 
React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow. It's more of a pattern rather than a formal 
framework, and you can start using Flux immediately without a lot of new code.
